# Password Manager

## Overview

This project is a simple password manager designed to store user credentials securely on a single device. It allows users to generate strong passwords and manage their credentials efficiently, thereby helping to mitigate the risks associated with password reuse and data breaches. 

## Features

- **Secure Storage**: Credentials are encrypted using a master passphrase and stored locally in a JSON file.
- **Strong Password Generation**: Generate secure and complex passwords using cryptographic randomness.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple command-line interface for interacting with the password manager.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository from GitHub to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PasswordManager.git
cd PasswordManager
```

### Set Up the Virtual Environment

Create a virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Install Required Libraries

Install the necessary dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Application

To start the password manager, run the following command:

```bash
python password_manager.py
```

### Interacting with the Application

1. First, you'll be prompted to enter your master passphrase:
   - This passphrase must be at least 8 characters long
   - Remember this passphrase as it's required to access your passwords

2. Choose one of the following actions:
   - **Add a Credential**: Type `add` to save a new service credential.
     - You will be prompted to enter the service name, username, and password (you have the option to generate a random password by leaving the password input blank).
   - **Retrieve a Credential**: Type `get` to retrieve an existing credential.
     - Enter the service name for which you want to retrieve the username and password. 
   - **Exit**: Type `exit` to close the application.

### Example Interaction

```plaintext
Enter your master passphrase: MySecurePassphrase123
Do you want to add or get a credential? (add/get/exit): add
Enter the service name: Gmail
Enter your username: user@gmail.com
Enter your password (or leave blank to generate a random one): 
Generated password: J4uT!e&D*2sX
Credential saved.

Do you want to add or get a credential? (add/get/exit): get
Enter the service name to retrieve: Gmail
Username: user@gmail.com, Password: J4uT!e&D*2sX
```

## Security Model

This password manager employs robust security measures to protect user credentials:

1. **Encryption**: 
   - Credentials are encrypted using AES (via the `cryptography` library)
   - The encryption key is derived from the user's master passphrase using PBKDF2
   - No encryption key is stored on disk

2. **Key Management**:
   - Instead of storing an encryption key, the application uses a master passphrase
   - The master passphrase is used to derive the encryption key using a key derivation function
   - This means the security relies on something the user knows (the passphrase) rather than something stored on disk

3. **Password Generation**:
   - The application uses Python's `secrets` module to generate strong passwords
   - Utilizes cryptographically secure random source to ensure unpredictability

## Discussion

### What Do We Protect Against?

The application is designed to protect against:

- **File Access**: Even if someone gains access to the encrypted password file, they can't decrypt it without the master passphrase
- **Malicious Software**: The master passphrase is never stored on disk
- **Physical Theft**: If the device is stolen, the encrypted data remains secure without the master passphrase

### Security Considerations

- **Best Practices**: Uses industry-standard cryptographic practices (PBKDF2 for key derivation, AES for encryption)
- **User Responsibility**: The security depends on choosing and protecting a strong master passphrase

## Limitations

- **Single Device Storage**: The password manager currently supports storing credentials only on a single device
- **Master Passphrase Recovery**: There is no way to recover passwords if the master passphrase is forgotten
- **Memory Security**: The master passphrase and decrypted passwords exist in memory while the program runs

## Dependencies

The following Python packages are required:
- cffi==1.17.1
- cryptography==43.0.1
- pycparser==2.22

These can be installed using the provided requirements.txt file.
